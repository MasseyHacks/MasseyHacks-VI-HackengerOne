The NBA Draft Combine is known as one of the most physically demanding tests for an athlete. Karl, our star player and MVP, is preparing for the draft. As a STUDENT-ATHLETE, he recognizes the importance of balancing academics AND athletics! His mental/physical workout is shown below, with each entry representing one exercise followed by the number of repetitions. <br><br>Burpees: (height, in feet, of a regulation basketball hoop) x (number of noble gases) <br>Squats: (<b>SECOND</b> most recent release of python 2 without dots) x (number of teams in the NBA)<br>Box Jumps: (height, in inches, of the NBA combine vertical record)  x (7th prime number)<br>Deadlifts: (number of letters in @jlin7’s first name) x (number of credits to earn OSSD)<br><br>After completing all of those reps, Karl is tired. But he knows he knows he still has to put in his Cardio! Karl is a perfectionist and wants the sum of his daily reps and daily steps to be exactly 100 000. How many steps does he still have to take?</span>
